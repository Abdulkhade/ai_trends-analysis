## Overview

This project analyzes AI industry trends to evaluate how artificial intelligence events and adoption influence business revenue growth and stock market performance.
The project highlights my data analyst skills in:

Collecting and cleaning real-world datasets.

Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Creating professional visualizations to communicate insights.

Translating raw data into actionable business conclusions.

The focus is on insights and storytelling — turning data into clear narratives for decision-makers.

## Dataset

Source: [Insert dataset source – e.g., Kaggle or custom dataset]

Size: X rows × Y columns

Key Features:

Event → AI-related event type (launch, announcement, etc.)

AI_Revenue_Growth_% → Growth % in revenue due to AI adoption

Stock_Impact_% → Change in stock performance after events

HasEvent → Binary indicator (1 = event, 0 = no event)

✅ The dataset was cleaned and structured to ensure reliability of insights.

## Analysis Process

The analysis was conducted in a step-by-step workflow:

Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing column formats.

Descriptive Statistics – Understanding central tendency, variation, and distributions.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying trends, anomalies, and relationships.

Visualization – Generating charts and plots to support storytelling.

Insight Generation – Extracting business-friendly findings from data patterns.

## Visualizations
The following plots were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Boxplot → Revenue Growth (%) across event categories.

Histogram → Distribution of stock impact for companies with vs. without AI events.

Heatmap → Correlations between event presence, revenue growth, and stock impact.

These visualizations were designed for clarity and business-friendly storytelling.

## Key Insights
Companies with AI-related events consistently showed higher revenue growth compared to those without.

AI adoption had a positive correlation with stock market performance.

Significant events (such as product launches or announcements) triggered measurable short-term business performance boosts.

Data storytelling revealed that AI is not only a technology trend but also a business growth driver.

## Future Improvements
Incorporate time-series analysis to study long-term AI adoption patterns.

Develop an interactive dashboard (Power BI, Tableau, or Streamlit) for executives to explore trends dynamically.

Expand dataset with more industries and time periods for richer insights.

Include predictive analytics to forecast potential business impact of AI-related events.


## Pipeline

The workflow is represented as a structured pipeline:
📊 Data Analysis Pipeline
│── 📥 Data Collection         # Gather dataset from source
│── 🧹 Data Cleaning           # Handle missing values, duplicates, formatting
│── 🔍 Exploratory Analysis    # Descriptive stats, distributions, correlations
│── 📑 Feature Analysis        # Compare event vs non-event, derive insights
│── 📊 Visualization           # Boxplots, histograms, heatmaps
│── 📝 Reporting & Insights    # Summarize findings, document results

## Technologies Used
Python → Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)

Visualization → Matplotlib, Seaborn (charts & plots)

Environment → Jupyter Notebook

(Optional) → Power BI / Tableau for dashboarding
